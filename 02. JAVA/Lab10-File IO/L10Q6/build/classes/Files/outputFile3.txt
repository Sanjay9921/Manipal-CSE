Ryan Gosling is literally me.I loved acting in Blade Runner 2049 and Drive 2011.When Ryan Gosling saw automated Joi in Blade Runner 2049, I felt the same.He is me and I am him. While Patrick Bateman and Lou Bloom are not literally me characters, their films are also added to the Sigma genre. I have no work please help.
